# My Approach
As always, I separate these challenges into different parts. In the first part, I try to access each array index, so a loop is the answer. while and foreach loop could also be used, I prefer the classic 'for' loop. In the next part, I calculate the sum of the left and right-side indexes. Finally, I apply one more condition. In the first loop, the left side of the index is empty, but in this challenge, it has to mean 0.

# Simplification
Arrays are one of the most commonly used data types in programming languages and are a type of linear data structure. Therefore, it is essential to know how to work with arrays. Each programming language has different functions for dealing with arrays. In this challenge, you will become familiar with and work with the functions array_sum and array_slice. To complete this challenge, you must access each array index and determine whether the sum of the elements to the left and right of this specific index is the same or not.
